# Computational-Structural-Genomics

Out lab’s mission is to develop the scientific, knowledge representation, and communication approaches, that will empower Next-Gen Genomics Interpretation.
•	Our premise is that Genomics + Physics + Data Science + Cell Biology + Biochemistry + Biophysics > Genomics. Said another way, that translating basic and computational sciences into genomics will add new data to enhance information and develop new knowledge.
•	Our vision is, “Your Genome, Interpreted.”
•	Interpreting genomics data using structural bioinformatics, structural and functional genomics, and integrative data science.
•	Advanced computational modeling of genetic mutations that drive cancer and define genetic diseases, to identify molecular causes and towards mutation-specific druggability.
•	Defining new genetic diseases by identifying underlying molecular mechanisms of heritable syndromes.
