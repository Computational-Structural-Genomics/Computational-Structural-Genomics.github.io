# Computational-Structural-Genomics

Out labâ€™s <b>Mission</b> is to develop the scientific, knowledge representation, and communication approaches, that will empower <strong>Next-Gen Genomics Interpretation</strong>.
<ul>
  <li>Our <b>Premise</b> is that <em>Genomics + Physics + Data Science + Cell Biology + Biochemistry + Biophysics > Genomics</em>. Said another way, that translating basic and computational sciences into genomics will add new data to enhance information and develop new knowledge.</li>
  <li>Our <b>Vision</b> is, <i>Your Genome, Interpreted</i>.</li>
  <li>Interpreting genomics data using structural bioinformatics, structural and functional genomics, and integrative data science.</li>
  <li>Advanced computational modeling of genetic mutations that drive cancer and define genetic diseases, to identify molecular causes and towards mutation-specific druggability.</li>
  <li>Defining new genetic diseases by identifying underlying molecular mechanisms of heritable syndromes.</li>
</ul>
